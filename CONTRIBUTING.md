# Getting Involved

New contributors are always welcome, and when in doubt please ask questions! We strive to be an open and welcoming community. Please be nice to one another.

I recommend heading over to fog's [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/blackms/fog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and having a look around as well.  It has information and context about the state of the `fog` project as a whole.
